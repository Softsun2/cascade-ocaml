# ARTS 1704 - Project 2 - Music Video

Sterile instructions and sedative grace magnetized once to degrade forever. Beautiful visions of the impossible self.

Simple way to express whatever bleakness I've been feeling. Cascade by William Basinski.

## Filming

I think 4:3 with high fov fits this, keep in mind while filming.

### Clips

Concept: c1<-c2<-[c3]<-c4<-...<-cn where the brackets are the frame

The waves on the album cover appear to be rolling to the right. I figured each clip would be taken on my bike facing left the scene appears to be moving towards the left side of the frame. I would like to take as much of these as possible in low light, maybe I could crank down the iso or whatever to fake this.

Try to shoot for ~15 second clips (tape loop is about 12 seconds). Would only need 14 or so clips then. I can't use twixtor here to extend clips because I want to preserve the speed of motion.

Meat clips dark

* New neighborhood clone houses.
* New neighborhood weird street.
* Casperson path lamps.
* Casperson park lamps.
* Street by lifetime.
* Street by century.
* Street by north.
* Path at north
* Stadium at north? 
* Path by new neighborhood.
* Roundabout area?

Meat Clips light

* Stream by end of NP trail.
* Old neighborhood 1.
* Old neighborhood 2.
* CC mile training path.
* Cherry view park tunnel.
* That one park path.

Breaking consistency clips

* My gross hair in my face (maybe to display words at the beginning or something) ((directors cut LOL))
* Stopping in front of house (ender?)

## Editing
Cascade is a tape loop. Pick whatever portion of the loop to cut on repeatedly.

### Tone
Cold, fleeting, beautiful, yearning, longing...

* cc[0]: clear/clean, b&w.
* cc[-1]: grainy, scratched, deteriorating, b&w.
* framerate: 20-15? Maybe play with this dynamically as well.

### Effects
I would like to visualize the rolling motion of the tape loops transitioning between clips. Was thinking of using datamoshing or some sort of warp. Also to portray my interpretation of the song I would like the quality to deteriorate over the length of the video. Primarily with grain and maybe some film damage, wanted to experiment with changing the framerate as well. Could add some frame repeition moshing as well.
